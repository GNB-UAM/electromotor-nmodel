This is a library for the simulation of neural networks in an object
oriented fashion. It is written in heavily templated C++.

To install it, just type:
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake ..
> make install

The library will install a pkg-config file called "neun.pc" under
${prefix}/${project_name}/${project_version}/pkgconfig. If you want
other applications to be able to find it, you must add this directory
to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH
